Looks at whether solar activity (sunspot count) can predict UFO reports or other light/percpetual phenomena as it does the aurora

Compares monthly UFO signtings and sunspot activity (sunspot counts) data from 1997 - 2016 

Sunspot data: http://sidc.oma.be/silso/newdataset 

UFO data: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html

Test for patterns UFO sightings and sunspot counts with auto-correlation

Test coherence between the UFO and sunspot activity at diff. frequencies
