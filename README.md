## Solar activity and UFO reports
This report explores whether solar activity (sunspot count) can predict UFO reports or other light/percpetual phenomena as it does the aurora. 

#### About

There is reason to believe that UFO reports are misattributed natural phenomena. 

* Numerous pop culture articles on the internet link UFO reports to activity from the sun. The visual appearance of sunspots shares similarities with sun-linked UFO reports (for example seeing a number of black disks 'fly' across the sun).

* The academic literature contains some references to a correlation between solar activity and UFO reports, but there is sparse recent research.  

* Atmospheric and solar conditions are linked to unusual light phenomena like lightning balls and the aurora, which may be reported as UFOs. 

This analysis revisits the link between solar activity and UFO reports with more recent (and larger) UFO data set than used previosuly along with historical sunspot activity data from the Royal Observatory of Belgium website http://sidc.oma.be/silso/. The UFO data analysed here was primarily collected through an online reporting database NUFORC.org and covers the period of the internet (1996-onwards) increasing report rates. Data older than the nuforc.org website registration in 2001 was presumably added manually.


#### Details

Compares monthly UFO signtings and sunspot activity (sunspot counts) data from 1997 - 2016

Test coherence between the UFO and sunspot activity at diff. frequencies

Granger test if historical sunspot counts can predict UFO sightings

#### Results
The plotted data shows a seasonal cycle shared between UFO reports and sunspot count. 
This result is different to the null result reported by http://www.rense.com/general3/sunufo.htm (1940-1975) possibly due to when the nuforc data set was gathered (during the internet 1997-2013) and/or it's larger by nearly 8. 

#### Further questions
* Does UFO sighting duration vary in any systematic way?
* Likewise the shape of the reported UFO
* Location: does longitude/lattitude of UFO report shift with solar activity?
* Effect of internet on increase in UFO reports
