## solar activity
Looks at whether solar activity (sunspot count) can predict UFO reports or other light/percpetual phenomena as it does the aurora

Compares monthly UFO signtings and sunspot activity (sunspot counts) data from 1997 - 2016 

Sunspot data: http://sidc.oma.be/silso/newdataset source: (SILSO data/image, Royal Observatory of Belgium, Brussels)

UFO data: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html 

Test for patterns in UFO sightings and sunspot counts with auto-correlation

Test coherence between the UFO and sunspot activity at diff. frequencies

Granger test if sunspot and predict UFO sightings

#### Results
Looks like there is a seasonal cycle shared between UFO report and sunspot counts. 
This result is different to the null result reported by http://www.rense.com/general3/sunufo.htm (1940-1975) possibly due to when the nuforc data set was gathered (during the internet 1997-2013) and/or it's larger by nearly 8.
